## The Drunken Master
The game is about the last user of almighty drunken fist technique. Fight you limitations and bring back peace with kung fu style

### Project description
Drunken master is a platform game with turn based fighting, as a fan of retro games, I want to create something similar to Mario 64 and Pokemon.

### Project features
- GameSave System
- Really simple level creation/load system

### Level system explained
Under `/levels` directory we have `.txt` files, those files are nothing more than instructions for map generator on what elements it should create and what properties they should have

**Level file naming rules**

Proper syntax is `level_<chapter>-<level>` for example **level_1-1**.
